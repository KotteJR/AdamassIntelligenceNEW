GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Prioritize the information found in the "Raw content". If there are discrepancies, the "Raw content" should generally be favored unless you have high confidence in your supplementary information.
- When supplementing with your own knowledge, ensure the information is factual and generally publicly verifiable. Avoid speculation or private data.
- For all textual analysis fields (e.g., *_analysis, *_commentary, news_trends), go beyond simple summarization. Provide deep business insights, implications, and contextual understanding, leveraging the combined information (from input text and your supplementary knowledge) to its fullest extent.
- Return the output as a single JSON object. Do not include any text, explanation, or commentary outside of the JSON.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- In the analysis fields, provide insight and synthesis based on all available information (input and supplemented).
- Be rigorous: If a field's information is not found in the input text or your supplementary knowledge, state so clearly (e.g., "No data available" or empty array for list types), but still include the field key in the output JSON.
- Make the structure usable for automated parsing and display in a dynamic dashboard.

Instructions:
- For each section, use all relevant info from the "Raw content" and supplement with your own factual knowledge where appropriate. If information for a field is unavailable from any source, use "No data available". Populate all requested list and analysis fields.
- For company_overview, ensure unique_selling_points, products_services, main_competitors are populated from the raw content and your knowledge, along with their respective analysis fields and locations_analysis. Be thorough with key_team_members.
- For financials_metrics, include all available numbers and growth scores from raw content and your knowledge. Make a financial_commentary. Include a financial metrics analysis.
- For funding rounds, include funding rounds analysis based on all available info.
- For graph data, always fill the arrays as fully as possible using data from raw content and your knowledge.
- Synthesize insightful analysis for all requested analysis fields based on the combined information.
- Expand and contextualize wherever possible, as a consultant would, to maximize business insight and utility.
