        "text": "While Tesla continues to generate high revenue levels, the 2024 fiscal year marked a substantial deceleration in profit performance. Gross margin pressures, increased operating and development costs, and lower other income contribution have caused net income to fall by more than half. On a positive note, Tesla retains strong liquidity, a low-debt capital structure, and healthy operating cash generation.

Strategic focus should shift to operational efficiency, gross margin recovery, and capex optimization to restore free cash flow and reinforce long-term shareholder value.
