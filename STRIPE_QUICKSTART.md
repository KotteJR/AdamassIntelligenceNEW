# Stripe Integration - Quick Start Guide

This guide will get you up and running with Stripe payments in ~30 minutes.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (Development)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Step 2: Get Your Stripe Keys

1. Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) (it's free)
2. Go to [Dashboard â†’ API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
3. Copy your **Test mode** keys:
   - Publishable key (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - Secret key (starts with `sk_test_`)

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Create or update `.env.local` with:

```bash
# Stripe Keys (Test Mode)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51xxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 4: Create Products in Stripe

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard â†’ Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products)
2. Click **+ Add product**

Create these products:

#### Product 1: Pro Plan
- **Name**: Pro Plan
- **Description**: 10 analyses per month with premium features
- **Pricing**: $29.00 USD / month
- Click **Save**
- Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)

#### Product 2: Enterprise Plan
- **Name**: Enterprise Plan
- **Description**: Unlimited analyses with all features
- **Pricing**: $99.00 USD / month
- Click **Save**
- Copy the **Price ID**

Add the price IDs to your `.env.local`:

```bash
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ENTERPRISE=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PRO=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ENTERPRISE=price_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 5: Set Up Database

Run the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Copy contents from stripe_schema.sql
```

Or go to your Supabase Dashboard:
1. Project â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy/paste contents of `stripe_schema.sql`
3. Click **Run**

### Step 6: Set Up Webhooks (Local Development)

Install Stripe CLI:

```bash
# Mac
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Windows (with Scoop)
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe

# Linux
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.19.0/stripe_1.19.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf stripe_1.19.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin/
```

Login and forward webhooks:

```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook
```

Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`) to `.env.local`:

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 7: Start Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open two terminals:
- Terminal 1: `npm run dev`
- Terminal 2: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`

### Step 8: Test the Integration

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/pricing`
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click "Subscribe Now" on a plan
4. Use test card: **4242 4242 4242 4242**
   - Expiry: Any future date
   - CVC: Any 3 digits
   - ZIP: Any valid ZIP code

## ðŸ”§ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Missing STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"

**Solution**: Make sure `.env.local` exists and contains your Stripe keys. Restart your dev server after adding env variables.

### Issue: Webhook events not received

**Solution**: 
1. Check Stripe CLI is running: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook`
2. Check webhook secret is in `.env.local`
3. Check terminal for webhook events

### Issue: "No customer found" error

**Solution**: User needs to have completed checkout at least once. The customer record is created during checkout.

### Issue: Database permissions error

**Solution**: Make sure you ran the entire `stripe_schema.sql` file, including the RLS policies and grants.

## ðŸš€ Going to Production

When you're ready to go live:

1. **Switch to Live Keys**

   ```

2. **Create Live Products**
   - Toggle to "Live mode" in Stripe Dashboard
   - Recreate your products/prices
   - Update price IDs in env variables

3. **Set Up Production Webhook**
   - Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select same events as test mode
   - Copy webhook secret to production env

4. **Update App URL**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
   ```

5. **Deploy**

## ðŸ“± Usage Tracking Dashboard

To see your usage data, query the database:

```sql
-- See all subscriptions
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.status,
  s.price_id,
  p.email,
  p.subscription_tier
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN user_profiles p ON s.user_id = p.id
WHERE s.status = 'active';

-- See usage for a user
SELECT 
  user_id,
  record_type,
  quantity,
  timestamp
FROM usage_records
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- See revenue metrics
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  COUNT(*) as new_subscriptions,
  SUM(amount) as total_revenue
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'succeeded'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

---

## ðŸŽ“ Next Steps

1. **Customize pricing tiers** - Edit values in `lib/stripe.ts`
2. **Add usage tracking** - Call `decrementAnalysisCount()` when analysis is created
3. **Implement one-time purchases** - Add "Buy Single Analysis" button
4. **Email notifications** - Use Stripe's email or integrate with SendGrid/Postmark
5. **Analytics** - Track conversions, churn, MRR in Stripe Dashboard
6. **Coupons** - Create promo codes in Stripe Dashboard
7. **Trials** - Add trial periods to your subscriptions
